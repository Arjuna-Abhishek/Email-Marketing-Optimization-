This project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for improving the effectiveness of a software companyâ€™s direct mailing campaign. 

## Findings
The report suggests that the model accuracy derived from the neural network and decision tree classifier methods differed although they all share a number of similarities. Neural network performance accuracy for both the training and validation dataset was 81% and 80% respectively while the Decision Tree performance accuracy measured was 88% and 84% for both training and validation dataset respectively. This suggests that while the decision tree has a higher percentage of accuracy, It has an overfitting issue unlike the Neural network which has a lower accuracy but no issue with overfitting.

## Recommendations

To improve the cost-effectiveness of planning a mailing campaign, management should focus on the pointer which plays significant role in affecting the Purchase. Neural networks can be used as the best classification model for analysis.
